# Personal Website A2 — Kezia Taufiq

## Project Overview
A simple, clean portfolio built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Includes a separate **visualizations page** where all SVG graphics are generated **with JS** (`vis.js`).

## Structure
index.html
visualizations.html
style.css
main.js
vis.js
README.md

## What’s inside
- `index.html`: Resume-like homepage (intro, education, skills, experience, contact information).
- `visualizations.html`: Two JS-driven SVG visuals:
  1. Bar chart (favorite color)
  2. Random circle grid (creative art)
- `style.css`: Responsive and accessible styling using rem/% units.
- `main.js`: Hamburger menu toggle.
- `vis.js`: SVG helper functions + both visualizations.

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` and `visualizations.html` in a browser.
